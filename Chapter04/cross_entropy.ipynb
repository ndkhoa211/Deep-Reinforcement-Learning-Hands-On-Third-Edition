    "    3. `on-policy` or `off-policy`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. there are other ways to taxonomize RL methods, but for now we are interested in the above $3$. Let's define them (as the specifics of our problem can influence our choice of a particular method):\n",
    "    1. `model-free` or `model-based`:\n",
    "        - `model-free`: the method doesn't build a model of the environment or reward; it just directly connects observations to actions (or values that are related to actions)\n",
    "            - in other words, the agent takes current observations and does some computations on them, and the result is the action that it should take\n",
    "            - usually easier to train because it's hard to build good models of complex environments with rich observations\n",
    "        - `model-based`: try to predict what the next observation and/or reward will be\n",
    "            - based on this prediction, the agent tries to choose the best possible action to take, very often making such predictions multiple times to look more and more steps into the future\n",
    "            - pure `model-based` methods are usually used in deterministic environments (e.g. board games with strict rules)\n",
    "        - all methods described in this book are from `model-free` category (as they have been the most active area of research for the past few year)\n",
    "            - only recently have researchers started to mix the benefits from both worlds (refer to [Chapter20](../Chapter20/) and take a look of the `AlphaGo Zero` and `MuZero` methods, which use a model-based approach to board games and Atari)\n",
    "    2. `value-based` or `policy-based`:\n",
    "        - `policy-based` (PART 3): directly approximate the policy of the agent (what actions the agent should carry out at every step)\n",
    "            - the policy is usually represented by a probability distribution over the available actions\n",
    "        - `value-based` (PART 2): instead of the probability of actions, the agent calculates the value of every possible action and chooses the action with best value\n",
    "    3. `on-policy` or `off-policy`: will be discussed in depth in PARTS 2 & 3\n",
    "        - `off-policy`: is able to learn from historical data (obtained by a previous version of the agent, recorded by human demonstration, or just seen by the same agent several episodes ago)\n",
    "        - `on-policy`: require fresh data for training, generated from the policy we're currently updating\n",
    "            - they cannot be trained on old historical data because the result of the training will be wrong -> less data-efficient (we need much more communication with the environment)\n",
    "            - but in some case, this is not a problem (the environment is very lightweight and fast, so we can quickly interact with it)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. the `CE method` falls into the `model-free`, `policy-based`, and `on-policy` categories of methods, which means:\n",
    "    1. it doesn't build a model of the environment; it just says to the agent what to do at every step\n",
    "    2. it approximates the policy of the agent\n",
    "    3. it requires fresh data obtained from the environment"

    "1. Recall that the agent tries to accumulate as much total reward as possible by communicating with the environment:\n",
    "    - in practice, we follow a common ML approach and replace all the complications of the agent with some kind of nonlinear function, which maps the agent's input (observations from the environment) to some output\n",
    "    - output may depends on a particular method or a family of methods (such as `value-based` or `policy-based` methods)\n",
    "    - as our `CE method` is `policy-based`, our nonlinear function (`neural network (NN)`) produces the `policy`, which basically says for every observation which action the agent should take\n",
    "    - in research, `policy` is denoted as $\\pi(a|s)$, where:\n",
    "        - `a`: actions\n",
    "        - `s`: the current states\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A high-level approach to `policy-based` RL: ![A high-level approach to policy-based RL](../images/figure_4-1.png)\n",
    "    - in practice, the policy is usually represented as a probability distribution over actions (very similar to a classification problem, with the number of classes being equal to the number of actions we can carry out)\n",
    "    - this abstraction makes our agent very simple: it needs to pass an observation from the environment to the NN, get a probability distibution over actions, and perform random sampling using the probability distribution to get an action to carry out\n",
    "        - this random sampling adds randomness to our agent (a good thing because at the begining of the training, when our weights are random, the agent behaves randomly)\n",
    "        - as soon as the agent gets an action to issue, it fires the action to the environment and obtains the next observation and reward for the last action. Then the loop continues\n",
    "\n",
    "3. during the agent's lifetime, its experience is presented as episodes:\n",
    "    - every episode is a sequence of observations that the agent has got from the environment, actions it has issued, and rewards for these actions\n",
    "        - imagine that our agent has played several episodes\n",
    "        - for every episode, we can calculate the total reward that the agent has claimed (can be discounted or not discounted)\n",
    "        - for simplicity, assumue a discount factor of $\\gamma = 1$, i.e. an undiscounted sum of local rewards for every episode\n",
    "    - this total reward shows how good this episode was for the agent\n",
    "        - ![Example episodes with their observations, actions, and rewards](../images/figure_4-2.png) contains $4$ episodes (note that different episodes have different values for $o_i$, $a_i$, and $r_i$)\n",
    "        - every cell represents the agent's step in the episode\n",
    "        - due to randomness in the environment and the way that the agent selects actions to take, some episodes will be better thatn others\n",
    "    - the core of the `CE method` is to throw away bad episode and train on better ones. The steps of `CE method`:\n",
    "        1. play $N$ episodes using our current model and environment\n",
    "        2. calculate the total reward for every episode and decide on a reward boundary\n",
    "            - usually we use a percentile of all reward, e.g. $50{th}$ or $70^{th}$\n",
    "        3. throw away all episodes with a reward below the boundary\n",
    "        4. train on the remaining `\"elite\"` episodes (with rewards higher than the boundary) using observations as the input and issued actions as the desired output\n",
    "        5. repear from step `1.` until we become satisfied with the result\n",
    "    - with `CE method`, our NN learns how to repeat actions, which leads to a larger reward, constantly moving the boundary higher and higher"

    "1. **Line 18-28**: implement `DiscreteOneHotWrapper` class/transformation as an (inherited from) `gym.ObservationWrapper`:\n",
    "    - to minimize the required changes in our implemenetation, we can apply one-hot encoding of discrete inputs (i.e. the input to our NN will have $16$ float numbers and zero everywhere, except the index that we will encode that representing our current position on the grid)\n",
    "    - with this wrapper applied to the environment, both the observation space and action space are $100%$ compatible with our CartPole solution\n",
    "        - however we can see that our training doesn't improve the score over time\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Let's take a look of some visualizations:\n",
    "    1. Mean reward: ![FrozenLake naive mean reward](../images/ch04_frozenlake_naive_reward_mean.png)\n",
    "    2. Loss: ![FrozenLake naive loss](../images/ch04_frozenlake_naive_loss.png)\n",
    "    3. Reward boundary during the training: ![FrozenLake naive reward boundary during the training](../images/ch04_frozenlake_naive_reward_bound.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Let's take a deeper look at the reward structure of both environments:\n",
    "    1. In Cartpole, every step of the environment gives us the reward $1.0$, until the moment that the pole falls\n",
    "        - the longer our agent balanced the pole, the more reward it obtained\n",
    "        - due to randomness in agent's behavior, different episodes were of different lengths, which gave us a pretty normal distribution of the episodes' rewards\n",
    "        - after choosing a reward boundary, we rejected less successful episodes and learned how to repeat the better ones (by training on successful episodes' data)\n",
    "        - reward distribution in the CartPole environment: ![Reward distribution in the CartPole environment](../images/figure_4-9.png)\n",
    "    2. In FrozenLake, we get the reward of $1.0$ only when we reach the goal, and this reward says nothing about how good each episode was\n",
    "        - the distribution of rewards for our episodes is also problematic\n",
    "            - $2$ kinds of episodes possible, and failed episodes will obviously dominate at the beginning of the training, when the agent acts randomly\n",
    "        - so our percentile selection of elite episodes is totally wrong and gives us bad examples to train on\n",
    "        - reward distribution in the FrozenLake environment: ![Reward distribution in the FrozenLake environment](../images/figure_4-10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This example shows us the limitations of the `CE method`:\n",
    "    1. for training, our episodes have to be finite (in general, could be infinite) and preferably short\n",
    "    2. total reward of the episodes should have enough variability to separate good episodes from bad ones\n",
    "    3. it is beneficial to have an intermediate reward during the episode instead of having the reward at the end of the episode\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A list of tweaks:\n",
    "    1. `larger batches of played episodes`: require at leasr $100$ episodes just to get some successful episodes\n",
    "    2. `discount factor applied to the reward`: use a discoundted total reward with the discount factor of $\\gamma=0.9, 0.95$ to make the total reward for an episode depend on its length, and to add variety in episodes\n",
    "        - reward for short episodes will be higher than for long ones\n",
    "        - this increases variability in reward distribution\n",
    "    3. `keeping elite episodes for a longer time`: a successful episode is rare --> keep for several iterations to train on them\n",
    "    4. `decreasing the learning rate`: give NN time to average more training samples, as a smaller lr decreases the effect of new data on the model\n",
    "    5. `much longer training time`: due to the sparsity of successful episodes and the random outcome of our actions, it's much harder for NN to get an idea of the best behavior to perform in any particular situation\n",
    "        - to reach $50%$ successful episodes, about $5000$ training iterations are required\n",
